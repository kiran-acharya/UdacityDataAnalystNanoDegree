  <h1>We studied the baseball data to come up with a question for the world -> Are right handed or left handed baseball players better?</h1>
  <div id="hand-barplot" class="story-text">
    <h2>Lets see a plot for handedness of baseball players</h2>
    <div class="plot-container">
     </div>
    <p>From a sample of 891 baseball players, we see that around 60% are right handed,
    almost 30% are left handed and 10% are ambidextrous. This puts up a question, which of right/left handed
    athlete perform better in baseball?</p>
  </div>
  <div id="avg-boxplot" class="story-text">
    <h2>Now since handedness is found to be a factor affecting performance lets check a plot of batting average against handedness</h2>
    <p><b>What is batting average?</b></br>In baseball, the batting average (BA) is defined by the number of hits divided by at bats. 
    It is usually reported to three decimal places and read without the decimal: 
    A player with a batting average of .300 is "batting three-hundred." A point (or percentage point) is understood to be .001 . 
    If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken to more than three decimal places.
    </p>
    <p class="citation-from"><em>from: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average#Major_League_Baseball">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average#Major_League_Baseball</a></em></p>
    <div class="plot-container">
    </div>
    <p>
    	According to the plot we can conclude the median batting average of left-handed players is higher than right-handed and ambidextrous players.
    	<b>Left-handed players have less variability in their batting average.</b>

    <h2>Lets find out who scored more homeruns and plot them against handedness! - looks interesting</h2>
    <p><b>What is a home run?</b><br>An <em>inside-the-park home run</em> occurs when a batter hits the ball into play and is able to circle 
    the bases before the fielders can put him out. Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners 
    are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases. 
    This can only happen if the ball does not leave the ballfield.

      Left-handed players have a median number of home runs
      higher than the other players.

  <div id="why-better" class="story-text">
    <h2>Baseball is great but, what's up with this handedness?</h2>
    Question arises are left-handed people more athletic? Why do they tend to perform better in
    baseball and why are they present in higher proportion than in the general
    population? <b>The short answer: baseball is built for lefties.</b>
